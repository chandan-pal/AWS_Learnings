AWS EBS, EFS and S3 storage

EBS - high availability block-level storage volumes for EC2 instances.
EBS stores data on block system which is retained after the EC2 instance is shut down.
- Increase throughput by devoting network capacity and minimizing the network contention between your instances and EBS.
- By using SSD EBS volumes, it offers reliable I/O performance scaled to meet your workload needs.
- EBS volumes offer redundancy within its Availability Zones while access control and encryption bolster security.
- Two EC2 instances cannot share one EBS volume.
- You can change EBS volume size and storage type on the fly.
- You can use Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (Amazon DLM) to automate the creation, retention, and deletion of snapshots taken to back up your Amazon EBS volumes, at no additional cost.


EFS offers scalable file storage, optimized for EC2
EFS can be used as a common data source for any application or workload that runs on numerous instances
- EFS can be shared over multiple EC2 instances
- EFS is the best choice for running any application that has a high workload, rapidly changing data, requires scalable storage, and must produce output quickly.
- Use it for running shared volumes, or for big data analysis.
- you can use Lifecycle Management to transfer files that have been unused for a month to a more cost-effective storage class, which can lower expenses up to 85%.
- EFS can encrypt your data, whether itâ€™s in transit or at rest.



S3 is an object store, good for storing vast number of backups or user files
S3 is not limited to EC2, unlike EFS and EBS
S3 also supports static web content hosting that can be accessed from the S3 bucket or from AWS CloudFront. 
Storing data throughout S3 storage classes saves costs and maintains high levels of performance.
you can make the transfer using an S3 Lifecycle policy.



EBS is only accessible from a single EC2 instance in particular AWS region, while EFS allows to mount the file system across multiple regions and instances.
