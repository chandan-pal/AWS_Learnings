file systems : manages data as files and file hierarchy
block store  : manages data as blocks within sectors and tracks
object store : manages data as objects

S3
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
S3 provides unlimited storage
In S3 everything is object, which may consist of key, value, version ID, metadata

S3 storage classes:
1. Standard (default) : Fast, 99.99% availability, 11 9's durability, replicated across at-least three AZs (cost highest)
2. Intelligent Tiering : uses ML to analyze usage and determine appropriate class (may be less costlier than standard)
3. Standard Infrequenytly accessed : reduced availibility. additional retrieval fee is applied. (Cheaper than standard)
4. One Zone Infrequenytly accessed : only available in one Az, 99.5% availibility, reduced durability (cheaper than standard IA)
5. Glacier : for long term cold storage, retrieval can take from minutes to hours. (very cheap)
6. Glacier deep archive : data retrieval time is 12 hours (lowest cost)

S3 security:
- all new buckets are private
- access control is configured using BUCKET POLICIES and ACCESS CONTROL LIST
- MFA delete (versioning is required)
- security in transit : uploading is done over SSL
- there is option to enable server side encryprion (using AES, KMS or customer provided key)

S3 Cross Region Replication (CRR):
- can be enabled to automatically replicate to another region, for potential disaster recovery.
- for this versioning should be turned on for both source and destination buckets
- CRR can also replicate to another AWS account

S3 lifecycle management:
- lifecycle management gives various rules like moving objects to different S3 class, deleting objects etc.
- can be used together with versioning
- can be applied to both current and previous versions

S3 pre-signed URLS:
- a url to provide temporary access to an object to either upload or download object data.
- commonly used to provide access to private objects
